# react-game-template

Some basic TypeScript scaffolding to get started with React game development. This project was bootstrapped with `npx create-react-app react-game-template --template typescript`.

It consists of a basic Scene component with an update method that gets triggered by the [`window.requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) method for efficient rendering at maximum frame rate.

It counts updates, keeps track of window resizing, an example SVG canvas is created and a circle moves across the scene...

## Usage

Ensure [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com) is installed and:

- `yarn`
- `yarn start`
